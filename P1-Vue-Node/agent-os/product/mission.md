# Product Mission

## Pitch
Simple Todo Manager is a progressive learning platform that helps beginner web developers master full-stack development by building a familiar todo application that evolves from basic Vue.js concepts to complete client-server architecture with database persistence.

## The Problem

### Learning Full-Stack Development is Overwhelming
Most web development tutorials either focus on isolated concepts without context or dive into complex applications that intimidate beginners. Students learn Vue.js in one course, Node.js in another, and databases separately - but never see how they connect into a cohesive application. This fragmented learning leads to confusion, frustration, and abandoned projects.

**Our Solution:** We provide a single, familiar application (a todo manager) that progressively introduces concepts in a logical sequence. Each phase builds on previous knowledge, demonstrating how frontend, backend, and database layers connect. By focusing on one application throughout the learning journey, students see immediate progress and understand the "why" behind each technology choice.

### AI-Assisted Development Needs Practice Grounds
Developers exploring AI coding assistants need well-defined, incremental projects to practice effective collaboration. Many projects are either too trivial or too complex to learn proper specification writing and task breakdown.

**Our Solution:** Each feature in Simple Todo Manager is clearly scoped, documented, and incrementally complex - perfect for practicing agent-driven development. The project teaches both coding skills and the meta-skill of working effectively with AI assistants.

## Differentiators

### Progressive Complexity with Purpose
Unlike traditional tutorials that teach everything at once, we introduce exactly one new concept per phase. Each feature builds naturally on previous work, so students always understand why they're learning something new. The progression from static display to database persistence mirrors real-world development - start simple, add complexity only when needed.

### Learning Through Familiarity
Everyone understands todo lists. By using a universally familiar application, students focus on learning technology rather than understanding domain logic. This reduces cognitive load and accelerates learning.

### Production-Ready Practices from Day One
We don't teach "beginner code" that needs to be unlearned later. From the first commit, students use Vue 3 Composition API, modern JavaScript, proper project structure, and testing frameworks. The skills learned transfer directly to professional development.

### Dual Learning Paths
The project serves both traditional learners (following step-by-step guides) and AI-assisted developers (practicing specification writing and agent collaboration). This makes it uniquely valuable for modern development education.

## Key Features

### Core Features
- **Static Welcome Display:** Learn Vue.js fundamentals by rendering a simple "Hello World!" message, understanding component structure and template syntax without complexity
- **Interactive Counter:** Master Vue reactivity and state management through increment/decrement buttons, building intuition for how data flows in modern frameworks
- **Frontend Todo List:** Implement complete CRUD operations with localStorage persistence, learning forms, lists, event handling, and browser storage APIs

### Full-Stack Features
- **Express API Backend:** Transform the frontend-only app into a client-server architecture, understanding HTTP methods, REST principles, and API design
- **Database Persistence:** Replace localStorage with SQLite database storage, learning SQL fundamentals, data modeling, and server-side state management

### Developer Experience Features
- **Progressive Documentation:** Each phase includes clear learning objectives, implementation guides, and "what you learned" summaries
- **Testing Examples:** Every feature demonstrates corresponding tests, teaching TDD principles alongside implementation
- **Agent-Friendly Specifications:** Features are documented as clear, actionable specs perfect for AI-assisted development practice

## Core Values

### Simplicity First
We prioritize clarity over completeness. Every technology choice favors beginner-friendly setup and minimal configuration. SQLite over PostgreSQL. No build complexity. No unnecessary abstractions.

### Progressive Learning
Each phase introduces exactly one new concept. Students never face multiple unknowns simultaneously. Complexity grows naturally as understanding deepens.

### Hands-On Mastery
Understanding comes from building, not reading. Every concept is immediately applied in working code. Students see their changes running instantly.

### Production Practices
We teach professional development from the start. Modern frameworks (Vue 3), current best practices (Composition API), proper tooling (ESLint, Prettier, Vitest), and clear code organization.

## Success Metrics
