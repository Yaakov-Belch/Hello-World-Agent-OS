# Spec Initialization

## Feature Description

Full-Stack Todo Application Backend and Integration

This spec covers implementing the remaining roadmap items for the Hello World Agent OS learning project:

5. Express API Server — Create a Node.js/Express backend with REST endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for todos, teaching HTTP methods, routing, middleware, and API design principles. `M`

6. Frontend API Integration — Refactor frontend to fetch todos from the Express API instead of localStorage, demonstrating async/await patterns, fetch API usage, and client-server communication. `S`

7. SQLite Database Setup — Configure SQLite database with todos table schema and implement database connection layer, introducing SQL fundamentals, data modeling, and database initialization. `M`

8. Database-Backed API — Update Express endpoints to read/write from SQLite instead of in-memory storage, teaching SQL queries, database transactions, and persistent server-side state. `M`

This follows the progressive learning path from the existing Vue frontend (features 1-4 already completed) to introduce full-stack architecture concepts.
