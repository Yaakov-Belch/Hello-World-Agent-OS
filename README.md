# Hello-World-Agent-OS
Learn Spec-Driven AI Agent Coding with Agent OS: From Zero to Something.

## Basic setup before experimenting yourself

Here is what I did to get to where I am now.

* Go to: https://buildermethods.com/
* Scroll down and click on: Agent OS [USE IT >]
* Optional: Watch the demo.
* Scroll Down to: Next Steps.
* Click on: Installation guide.
* click on the Copy button for the "curl" command.

```bash
$ cd  # Go to my home directory
# Paste the copied command into the shell
$ curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buildermethods/agent-os/main/scripts/base-install.sh | bash
```
* Keep a note of the command to run to install Agent OS into a project!
* Now, Agent OS is copied to my system.  I can install it easily into my projects.

```bash
# YOU DO THIS:
mkdir MyAgentOsProject
cd MyAgentOsProject

# I DID THIS:
# mkdir P1-Vue-Node
# cd P1-Vue-Node

# Run the command to install Agent OS into this project.  That's what we noted down:
~/agent-os/scripts/project-install.sh
```

* Look at my notes: [What-I-did](What-I-did/01-Plan-with-Chat.md)

* Do the same thing in your own project.
* Experiment.
